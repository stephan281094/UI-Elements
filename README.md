# UI Elements
A collection of beautifully crafted UI elements, so you don't have to!

### Running the code
This project is built using [Meteor](http://meteor.com) for faster prototyping.
Instead of having to set up a whole gulpfile, having to install SASS, having to install Coffeescript, having to install Bourbon etc, all you have to do is:
- [Install meteor](http://meteor.com/install)
- Run `meteor`
